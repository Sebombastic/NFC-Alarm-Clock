* INCREASE TEXT SIZE OF ALARM OPTIONS

* Check if the bold themed permission text needs to actually use the textId or
  if getText() can be used on the textview?

* Look up defaults like for auto dismiss, dismiss early, .... really all the
  times, and see if they should be in the resources directory?

* Weird stuff when selecting a color, the slider bar is all the way to black,
  and you try to change the color.

* Have option to use file chooser to select media?

* Add languages for India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Brazil & Portugal, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Long press repeat, NFC, and flashlight for quick options

* Overlay number over repeat button for custom repeat option?

* Have option to scroll alarm name instead of marquee it

* Figure out why I use home in NacFile
