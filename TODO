* Move easy to mess up strings to top

* Look into querying MediaStore.Downloads table?
  https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/media

* Improve look of warning selected directory dialog

* Check if the bold themed permission text needs to actually use the textId or
  if getText() can be used on the textview?

* Look up defaults like for auto dismiss, dismiss early, .... really all the
  times, and see if they should be in the resources directory?

* Weird stuff when selecting a color, the slider bar is all the way to black,
  and you try to change the color.

* Add languages for Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Portugal, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Long press repeat, NFC, and flashlight for quick options
