* Add icons for skip next alarm and auto delete. Need to update the database for the latter

* Add text where music plays in the Alarm Activity so that if the media isn't
  found, it'll be apparent to the user.

* Find a way to slow down speed of TTS.

* Add languages for India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, Poland, Turkey, France,
  Brazil & Portugal, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Italy

* Figure out why I use home in NacFile
